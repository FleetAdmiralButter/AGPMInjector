#### iGPU Information
- iGPU systems that have iGPU enabled checked "Yes" are based off the type of CPU the system you have selected is. Example: iMac18,3 has i7 7700k CPU which is Kaby Lake iGPU properties. All other systems that have the same type of iGPU device will use the same properties. What that means is that iMac18,1, iMac18,2 and iMac18,3 all have the same iGPU properties when you have iGPU enabled checked.

#### Adding additional iGPU for systems?
- If you find that you have a system that you use iGPU also but the appisn't generating iGPU properties for you, please send me a message with your CPU and SMBIOs that you are using.
